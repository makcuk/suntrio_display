# Remote display for SAJ SunTrio 
Very-very dirty project to make an remote display for solar inverter. What for ? Just for fun. Why you need it ? Imagine, your rig sits somewhere and you want to have a screen to check current generation power and how much solar energy already generated.

Simpliest way is to get something which can run web browser and point it to management interface. That is proper solution but my goal was to get something with large fonts and where I can reuse old equipment.

My project runs on Raspberry PI 2 with HDMI-VGA adapter and old LCD 19", so total cost of it is below $50
